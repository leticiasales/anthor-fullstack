# Full stack developer test for Anthor

Develop a simple movie catalog project that allows the user to create, edit, list, and see details for each movie.

## Questions

##### a. How do you intend to approach this project? What technologies have you decided to use for each part?

I'm containerizing the project using Docker so it can be run on any environment. The chosen language for the server is javascript, so I'm using Node.js, mainly because I saw it as an opportunity to acquire this knowledge, and Vue.js for the frontend.

##### b. Do you find this to be particularly challenging in any of its requirements?

My major challenge is doing it without mastering the programming language, mainly because of the automated tests. 

##### c. If you had a lot of time to do this, what would you do differently?

I think this answer will be clearer when I'm done.
